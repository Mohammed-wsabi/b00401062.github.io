## Introduction to Logic

- **Constructive type theory**: A system which is simultaneously a logic and a programming language, and in which propositions and types are *identical*.
- **Functional programming language**: A program is simply a value of a particular explicit type, rather than a state transformer.
- If the language allows general recursion, then every type contains at least one value, defined by the equation $`x=x`$.
