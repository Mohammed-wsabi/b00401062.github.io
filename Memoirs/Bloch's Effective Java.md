### Consider static factory methods instead of constructors

- Static factory methods have names.
- Static factory methods are not required to create a new object each time theyâ€™re invoked.
- Static factory methods can return an object of any subtype of their return type.
- The class of the returned object can vary from call to call as a function of the input parameters.
- The class of the returned object need not exist when the class containing the method is written.
- Classes providing only static factory methods (without public or protected constructors) cannot be subclassed.
- Static factory methods are hard for programmers to find.
