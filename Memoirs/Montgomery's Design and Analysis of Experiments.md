### Strategy of Experimentation

- **Best-guess approach**:
	- Switching the levels of one or two (or perhaps several) factors for the next test, based on the outcome of the current test.
	- No guarantee of success or that the best solution has been found.
- **One-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) approach**:
	- Selecting a starting point (**baseline**) for each factor, and then successively varying each factor over its range with the other factors held constant at the baseline level.
	- Fails to consider any possible **interaction** between the factors.
- **Factorial experiment**:
	- Factors are varied together, instead of one at a time.
	- All possible combinations of the two factors across their levels are used in the design.
- **Fractional factorial experiment**: A variation of the basic factorial design in which only a subset of the runs is used.
