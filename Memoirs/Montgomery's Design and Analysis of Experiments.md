### Strategy of Experimentation

- **Best-guess approach**:
	- Switching the levels of one or two (or perhaps several) factors for the next test, based on the outcome of the current test.
	- No guarantee of success or that the best solution has been found.
- **One-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) approach**:
	- Selecting a starting point (**baseline**) for each factor, and then successively varying each factor over its range with the other factors held constant at the baseline level.
	- Fails to consider any possible **interaction** between the factors.
- **Factorial experiment**:
	- Factors are varied together, instead of one at a time.
	- All possible combinations of the two factors across their levels are used in the design.
- **Fractional factorial experiment**: A variation of the basic factorial design in which only a subset of the runs is used.

### Some Typical Applications of Experimental Design

- Experimental design methods have found broad application in many disciplines.

### Basic Principles

- The three basic principles of experimental design are *randomization*, *replication*, and *blocking*.
- **Randomization**:
	- Both the allocation of the experimental material and the order in which the individual runs of the experiment are to be performed are randomly determined.
	- Averaging out the effects of extraneous factors that may be present.
- **Replication**:
	- An independent repeat run of each factor combination.
	- Allows the experimenter to obtain an estimate of the experimental error.
	- Permits the experimenter to obtain a more precise estimate of a parameter.
	- Replication â‰  Repeated measurements.
	- Reflects sources of variability both between runs and (potentially) within runs.
- **Blocking**:
	- A **block** is a set of relatively homogeneous experimental conditions.
	- Improves the precision with which comparisons among the factors of interest are made.
	- Reduces or eliminates the variability trasmitted from *nuisance factors*.
- **Nuisance factors**:
	- Factors that may influence the experimental response but in which we are not directly interested.
	- Classified as *controllable*, *uncontrollable*, or *noise* factors.
	- The blocking principle is often useful in dealing with *controllable* nuisance factors.
	- If a nuisance factor is *uncontrollable* but can be measured, analysis of covariance can often be used to compensate for its effect.
	- **Noise factor**: A factor that varies naturally and uncontrollably in the process can be controlled for purposes of an experiment.

### Guidelines for Designing Experiments

- Recognition of and statement of the problem
- Selection of the response variable
- Choice of factors, levels, and ranges
	- Once the experimenter has selected the design factors, the followings have to be determined:
		- The ranges over which these factors will be varied.
		- The specific levels at which runs will be made.
	- **Process knowledge**: A combination of practical experience and theoretical understanding.
	- When the objective of the experiment is *factor screening* or *process characterization*, the common practice is to keep the number of factor levels *low*.
	- In *factor screening*, the range over which the factors are varied should be broad.
	- The **cause-and-effect diagram (fishbone diagram)** is useful for organizing some of the information generated in pre-experimental planning.
- Choice of experimental design
- Performing the experiment
- Statistical analysis of the data
- Conclusions and recommendations
