### What is an ontology?

- Comparison between conceptual data models and ontologies:
    - Conceptual data models provide an application-speciﬁc implementation-independent representation of the data that will be handled by the prospective application.
    - Ontologies provide an application-independent representation of a speciﬁc subject domain (re)usable by multiple applications.
- Comparison between relational databases and ontologies:
    - Ontologies (knowledge bases) include the representation of the knowledge explicitly to infer implicit knowledge and detect inconsistencies of the knowledge base.
- Comparison between the "semantic" side and the “pragmatic” side of ontologies:
    - Semantic: the meaning represented in the ontology.
    - Pragmatic: the practicalities of using ontologies.
