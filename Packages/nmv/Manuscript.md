## Introduction

A normative model is also helpful in investigating normative development of the white matter with age. Previous studies have reported fragmented evidences of white matter microstructural alterations with age using diffusion MRI. Fronto-temporal connections were found to develop more slowly than other regions (Lebel, 2008). During adolescence, increase in FA was significant in the left arcuate fasciculus, the bilateral posterior internal capsule/thalamic radiation, the bilateral prefrontal gyrus, the right superior temporal gyrus, and the posterior corpus callosum (Ashtari, 2007; Clayden, 2012). From young adulthood onwards, the full brain FA was shown to be negatively correlated with age (from adulthood into late adulthood). Such decline was especially significant in the anterior corpus callosum, the bilateral anterior and posterior internal capsule, and the posterior periventricular regions, but not present in the splenium, and the temporal and occipital regions. (Pfefferbaum, 2000; Hsu, 2007).

## Methods

The age of peak/trough was identified on the GPR curve for each white matter bundle. The increase or decrease of the integrity was estimated with linear regression and its significance was determined by the p value of the slope. For tracts that have the peak/trough located at somewhere between 18 and 88 years of age, the GPR curve was split into two parts, on each of which linear regression was fitted separately. Otherwise, the tracts were properly modeled by a single linear regression. The slopes of linear models were examined with the two-tailed t test at the significance level of 0.05 with Bonferroni correction.

The white matter tracts were classified according to the age of peak/trough and whether the slope before and after the peak/trough were significant or not. We arbitrarily defined young adulthood as ages between 20 and 45.

## Results

Examples of the age of peak and linear regression fitted to the sample are shown in Figure 8. The p values of the slopes across 76 tracts are shown in Figure 9. Among the 76 tracts, no GPR curves displayed a convex pattern, i.e., the integrity-age curve was either strictly increasing/decreasing, or concave. In view of this result, we determined the age of peak alone.

The detail of the ages peak and the statistics of the slopes is listed in Table 1. The white matter tracts was classified according to whether the decreased after the age of peak is significant (Table 2) or not (Table 3) at the first level, and the age of peak at the second level. The tracts with significant decrease all reached the peak before age 45.

## Discussion

There are white matter tracts without significant slopes before and after the age of peak. This implies the age of peak does not fall in the range between 18 and 88, and that the integrity of those tracts remain relatively stable throughout the life once they have matured. In our study, we found that the cingulum bundle, the corticospinal tract, the anterior commissure, and the posterior commissure fell into this category.

Previous studies have shown that brain maturation continues into adolescence. We further demonstrated that this process does not end until young and even middle adulthood in both sexes. including the left arcuate fasciculus, the uncinate fasciculus, the left fornix, the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF), the right perpendicular fasciculus, the thalamic radiation originating from the prefrontal cortex, the optic radiation, and several bundles of the corpus callosum.
