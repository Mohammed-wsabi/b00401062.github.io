# Linkage Analysis

## Introduction

**Linkage ananlysis** bases its theory on a number of well-known laws developed by geneticists, of which the earliest and the most reputed one is **Mendel** (1822~1884). Although modern techqnies boast of complexity and accurary, linkage analysis is arguably the most cost-effective tool in detection of culprit genes responsible for certain genetic disorders.

## Genetic Linkage

The **Principle of Independent Assortment**, proposed by Mendel in 1865, describes how different genes independently separate from one another. Independent assortment of genes only applies under the assumption that genes of interest are located on different chromosomes and no translocation of gene from one chromesome to another occurs during meiosis. Most of the time, the behaviors of and interactions between chromosomes are far more complex than those described by the Princple of Independent Assortment. And it is the intricacy of their interaction that contriubtes to the diversity of life on the earth.

**Recombination frequency (RF)** (Î¸) is the frequency with which a single chromosomal crossover will take place between two genes during meiosis. A centimorgan (cM) is a unit that describes a recombination frequency of 1%. Genes located on different chromosomes assort independently and have a recombination frequency of 50%, while linked genes have a recombination frequency that is less than 50%. Since this measurement ignores double crossover, RF tends to underestimate the distance between two linked genes.

## Linkage Analysis

**Linkage analysis** borrows the concepts of genetic linkage and extends its application to exploration of unknown genetic disorder. It aims to correlate specific gene with a well-described phenotype that is reasonably suspected to be of genetic cause. Linkage analysis is especially advantageous voer other modalities when a significant number of members within a family are involved. In such case, a **pedigree** can be depicted in great detail.

Pedigrees lie in the core of linkage analysis. From a pedigree, the geneticist designs genetic markers whose loci are well described. Blood sample is then extracted from members within the pedigree and subsequent DNA is collected. Genetic markers  Logarithm of Odds (LOD)

## Examples

## Shortcoming

- Double crossover
- incomplete penetration
