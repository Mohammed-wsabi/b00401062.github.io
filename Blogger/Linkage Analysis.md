# Linkage Analysis

## Introduction

**Linkage ananlysis** bases its theory on a number of well-known laws developed by geneticists, of which the earliest and the most reputed one is **Mendel** (1822 ~ 1884). Although modern techqnies boast of complexity and accurary, linkage analysis is arguably the most cost-effective tool in detection of culprit genes responsible for certain genetic disorders.

## Genetic linkage

- **Recombination frequency (RF)**
- **Centimorgan (cM)**
- **Logarithm of odds (LOD)**

## Examples
