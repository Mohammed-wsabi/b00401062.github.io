# Linkage Analysis

## Introduction

**Linkage ananlysis** bases its theory on a number of well-known laws developed by geneticists, of which the earliest and the most reputed one is **Mendel** (1822 ~ 1884). Although modern techqnies boast of complexity and accurary, linkage analysis is arguably the most cost-effective tool in detection of culprit genes responsible for certain genetic disorders.

## Genetic linkage

The **Principle of Independent Assortment**, proposed by Mendel in 1865, describes how different genes independently separate from one another. Independent assortment of genes only applies under the assumption that genes of interest are located on different chromosomes and no translocation of gene from one chromesome to another occurs during meiosis. Most of the time, the behaviors of and interactions between chromosomes are far more complex than those described by the Princple of Independent Assortment. And it is the intricacy of their interaction that contriubtes to the diversity of life on the earth.

There are a number of metrics to describe the proximity of two loci both geologically and functionally. Two loci on the same chrome

### Recombination frequency (RF)
### Centimorgan (cM)
### Logarithm of odds (LOD)
