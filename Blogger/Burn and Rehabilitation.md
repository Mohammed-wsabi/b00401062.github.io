# Burn and Rehabilitation

PM&R is often consulted to see patients with burn injuries in the hope of improving their functional capacity. However, it is not always the case that the patients can benefit from rehabilitation. From the standpoint of PM&R, patients are expected to tolerate the therapies to improve their range of motion, muscle strength, and independence for ADL. More importantly, patients should not be injured by any therapies on them, like falls, skin tear, etc.

Criteria to discharge patients from the ICU to the rehabilitation facility includes:
1. Closed wounds without significant functional impairment from burn wound contractures.
2. Patient is receiving and tolerating full enteral nutritional requirements.
3. Patient is functionally independent from a rehabilitative standpoint.

For patients with hypertrophic burn scarring, there is preliminary evidence to suggest that scar massage may improve it. But to be honest, what PM&R can do is quite limited for these patients. Controlling morbidity should be their first priority.
