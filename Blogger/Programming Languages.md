# Programming Languages

There are quite a few programming languages, either proprietary or open-source, for programmers to choose from. What programming language is most suitable for a beginner is always a pastime dispute among computer engineers. The reason we have that many choices out there is that each language has its irreplaceable niche in the market. From **low-** to **high-** level, from **static-** to **dynamic-** typing, from **procedural** to **declarative** languages, combination of different features along the scale contributes to the diversity of programming languages. Another crucial characteristics about a programming language is its capacity in handling errors/exceptions during the execution of a program, which can vary substantially in different languages. Also, the history of a programming language plays an important role in determining its own niche. In short, a language is regarded as more friendly to certain disciplines of computer programming.

Programming languages generally support arithmetic operations, conditional expressions, loops, functions, etc. Other advanced designs to simplify the codes and reduce the burden on programmers include class, lambda expressions, complex native data structures, etc. One misconception I would like to point out is that one programming language is more powerful than another. The fact is that every language has the ability to complete a job that another can do. Technically speaking, all eligible programming languages are **Turing-complete**. The programs written in different languages all run on "Turing Machine", which is the common paradigm of modern computers.

## Java

[Java](https://www.java.com) is one of the few languages brought into being in the early history of computer programming. It is characterized by well-structured syntax but solicits inevitable criticism over its verbosity. Equipped with abundant built-in libraries, Java dominates in all but every field of computer science, including graphical user interface, network programming, database management, etc. It is also powered by a handful of open-source communities, of which the most well-known is [Apache](https://www.apache.org). The dominance of Java in the industry is unlikely to be chanllenged in the years to come. Java will undoubtedly keep evolving at a steady pace to adapt to the ever-changing world and the needs of its immense proponents.

## Coconut

[Coconut](http://coconut-lang.org) is designed to be a superset of [Python](http://python.org), which is by far the fastest-growing language and enters the top three languages as illustrated by several independent communitites in 2018. Its capability of functional programming on top of Python's intuitive syntax adds to the Coconut's readibility. In short, Coconut is regarded as more of a high-level, dynamic-typing, and multi-paradigm language, and, as a result, Coconut should be an ideal choice for a first-time programmer due to its user-friendly rules. Since Coconut code is rendered directly into Python equivalent, every Python module is also valid for Coconut. Coconut essentially inherits Python's heritage with negligible exceptions. 

## Wolfram

[Wolfram](https://www.wolfram.com) along with [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com) are two of the most popular proprietary languages. Largely influenced by LAPACK (a Fortran-based numerical analysis toolbox), both Wolfram and Matlab have one-based array, which alludes to their inextricable tie with Fortran. Originally designed to sit behind Mathematica, Wolfram did not come to public's attention till recent years. Wolfram is dynamic-typing, multi-paradigm, and undoubtedly a high-level language, equipped with a handful of built-in libraries tailored for matrix manipulations, digital signal processing, and symbolic programming. Its ambition to take over Matlab's dominance in both academic and commercial market is conspicuous, which guarantees its ongoing improvement in the foreseeable future despite in its humble inception.
