# Programming Languages

There are quite a few programming languages, either commercial or open-source, for programmers to choose from. What programming language is most suitable for a beginner is always a pastime dispute among computer engineers. The reason we have that many choices out there is that each language has its irreplaceble niche in the market. From low- to high-level, from static- to strong-typing, from declaritive to imperative languagues, combination of different features along the scale contributes to the diversity of programming languages. Another crucial characteristics about a programming language is its capacity in handling errors/exceptions during the execution of a program, which can vary substantially in different languages. Also, the history of a programming language plays an important role in determining its own niche. In short, a language can therefore be regarded as friendlier to one or more disciplines of computer programming, for example, systems programming, networks programming, database management, etc.

Porgramming languages generally support arithmetic operations, conditional expressions, loops, functions. Other advanced designs to simplify the codes and reduce the burden on programmers include class, lambda expressions, complex native data structures, etc. One misconception I would like to point out is that one programming language is more powerful than another. The turth is that every language has the ability to complete a job that another can do. Technically speaking, all eligible programming languages are **Turing-complete**. The programs written in different languages all run on "Turing Machine", which is the common paradigm of modern computers.

Due to my undergraduate major in computer science, I get a better look at different facets of programming. Some languages that I have adapted to in my day-to-day works include C, Kotlin, R, and Python. Depending on the purpose of a program, I choose a language that is most appropriate for that aim. For example, C and Kotlin may be languages of choice for softwares that have to interact with hardwares and computer networks; on the other hand, R and Python are more frequently-used for data analysis and machine learning.

## C

C has a long history, compared to other newcomers, which can date back to 1970s. It is extremely efficient due not only to less overloading for each instruction but also to direct compilation from human-redable code to Assembly code. C does not provide advanced data structures, which makes it a popular tool for classroom use, since students have to implement each data structure/algorithm from scratches instead of using a black-box without knowing what is inside.

## Kotlin

Kotlin is an elegant substitute for Java, which is to date the most widely-used language in industries. Kotlin does not have a solid user base but has been steadily gaining popularity since it was first incorporated into the developement of Android applications. Its intricate grammar gives its flexibility and considerably reduces the verbosity that would otherwise be evident in other languages, which makes it painless to debug the codes.

## R

Speaking of statistics, R is arguably the first choice coming to mind. Designed to mitigate the overwhelming pipeline during data analysis, R puts together common functionalities a statistician would need and wraps them into standalone functions. R is regarded as one of the easiest-to-learn languages compared to others that entail steep learning curve.

## Python

Python is thought of as the only language that can possibly replace the dominance of Java and C in forseeable future. Python incapsulates both low- and high-level functionalities into its coding library, and has been largely adapted for both general-purpose programming and data analysis. Its intuitive syntax is an attraction for beginners. In addition, its large user-base and solid open-source supprts have drawn attention from technology giants to development of Python-compatible APIs.
