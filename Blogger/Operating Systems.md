# Operating Systems

An **operating system** is like a disinterested intermediary between user applications and computer hardware. It is intangible but dominates the resources that come with a computer system, and manipulates how each program running on the machine interacts and shares the limited resources. No other words than **monarch** can better depict the role of an operating system. Despite its essence being a software, its privilege is utterly insuperable. An operating system is also responsible for the integrity of the programs reliant on it and deter the infringement from extraneous instructions unless directed otherwise. Certain core instructions are designed to be impregnable that even the most advanced hacking techniques dims and bows. The disputes over the design of an operating system contributes to the diversity of variants available on the market. The tremendous effort necessitated to bring into being a reliable and faithful system deters half-hearted laymen and shows off its taciturn intricacy and refinement to committed experts.
