# Operating Systems

An **operating system** is like a disinterested intermediary between user applications and computer hardware. It is intangible but dominates the resources that come with a computer system, and manipulates how each program running on the machine interacts and shares the limited resources. No other words than **monarch** can better depict the role of an operating system. Despite its essence being a software, its privilege is utterly insuperable. An operating system is also responsible for preventing the programs reliant on it from the infringement of outside world unless directed otherwise. Certain core instructions are designed to be secure that even the most advanced hacking techniques dims and surrenders. The disputes over the designs of an operating system contributes to the diversity of variants available on the market. The tremendous effort necessitated to bring into being a reliable and faithful system deters half-hearted laymen. Only committed experts are allowed to admire the silent intricacy and refinement that it shows off.
