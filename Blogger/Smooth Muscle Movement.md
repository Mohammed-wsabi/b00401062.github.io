# Smooth Muscle Movement

Smooth muscle contracts/relaxes in a completely different manner from striated muscle due to their microscopic structure and their distribution in the body. In the article, I will focus on the mechanism of smooth muscle contraction/relaxation.

First, I would like to make it clear what signals trigger the morphological change of smooth muscle. Generally speaking, there is no conscious control over it. The four things that control it are hormones, neurotransmitters, nitric oxide, and electric stimulus. Specifically, smooth muscle movement is controlled by the following first messengers:
- __Contraction__: Gq-protein coupled receptor (GqPCR) binding effectors, electric stimulus
- __Relaxation__: Gs-protein coupled receptor (GsPCR) binding effectors, nitric oxide (NO), atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP)

Smooth muscle movement pivots on the ratio of phosphorylated/dephosphorylated __myosin light chain (MLC)__. When the ratio of phosphorylated MLC rises, smooth muscle contracts, otherwise, it relaxes. The enzyme that phosphorylates MLC is __MLC kinase (MLCK)__, and the enzyme that dephosphorylates MLC is __MLC phosphatase (MLCP)__. First messengers transduce the signal to second messengers, which then induces MLCK and MLCP to contract and relax smooth muscle, respectively.

_GqPCR binding effectors_. Examples are acetylcholine on M1 and M3 muscarinic receptor, catecholamine on alpha-1 adrenergic receptor, and histamine on H1 receptor. There are yet tons of examples which can be appreciated on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gq_alpha_subunit). On binding of effectors, Gq protein alpha subunit detaches from GqPCR and finds __phospholipase C (PLC)__ to activate it. PLC then converts __PIP2__ into __IP3__ and __diacylglycerol (DAG)__. IP3 opens Ca channels on smooth endoplasmic reticulum (sER), causing the influx of Ca into cytoplasm and subsequent binding of Ca and __calmodulin__. The Ca-calmodulin complex activates MLCK, which in turn phosphorylates MLC.

_Electric stimulus_. When electric signal travels down the cell membrane, __L-type voltage gated Ca channels__ are opened, causing the influx of Ca into cytoplasm and subsequent binding of Ca and __calmodulin__. The Ca-calmodulin complex activates MLCK, which in turn phosphorylates MLC.

_GsPCR binding effectors_. Examples are catecholamine on beta-2 adrenergic receptor, and histamine on H1 receptor. Other examples can be appreciated on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gs_alpha_subunit). On binding of effectors, Gs protein alpha subunit detaches from GsPCR and finds __adenylate cyclase__ to activate it. Adenylate cyclase converts ATP to cAMP. cAMP then activates MLCP, which in turn dephosphorylates MLC.

_Nitric oxide (NO)_. NO diffuses across cell membrane and find __guanylate cyclase__ to activate it. Guanylate cyclase converts GTP to cGMP. cGMP then activates MLCP, which in turn dephosphorylates MLC.

_Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP)_. ANP receptor is a class of receptor guanylate cyclase. On binding of ANP, ANP receptor is linked to __guanylate cyclase__ and activates it. Guanylate cyclase converts GTP to cGMP. cGMP then activates MLCP, which in turn dephosphorylates MLC.
