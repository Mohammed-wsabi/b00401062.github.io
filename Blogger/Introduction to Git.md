# Introduction to Git

Building a project and tracking any changes made to it become overwhelming and formidable when the project is heavy enough. Multiple users may edit the same pieces of code. The integration of works from two programmers is simply impractical if this process is totally done from scratches. Moreover, code itself, although is written by human, is actually unreadable, even if the code that was written weeks ago by the same person.

Given the predicaments that a project team could face, there developed a tool among several other **version control tools**, called Git. **Git** is arguably by far the most widely-adopted tool in academics, open source projects, industries, etc. Other tools are also available, of which the second most popular is subversion (SVN), which is a default program installed in Unix/Linux distributions.

The rationale behind Git as well as all the other version control tools is pretty intuitive. These tools are designed to expedite coordination of codes developed on different computers, by different engineers. Any changes made to original copy are faithfully recorded and any conflicts between two versions is highlighted. Furthermore, comments are allowed to be made for each line of code to facilitate readability.

Git itself is a binary program that usually comes without GUI. Operations have to be done in a terminal window which takes in commands from end users. Thanksfully, software engineers have ported Git onto
